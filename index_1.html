          <p> <a href="http://hgcsweb.com/">Holly Grove Christian School</a></p>
          <p> Holly Grove Christian School was the high school I attended in Westover, MD. At the time I was attending, there was no source of advertisement for the school. The main way new students came was by hearing about it through word of mouth. While this was somewhat reliable in the small town I lived in, there was still no website where people could go to have a central place to find all the information. Over a few weeks, this website was put up. It has curretnly gone through one remodeling, which I did. As time has progressed, this site has proved vital to the school and is one small contribution that I could give to them. </p>
    
    
          <h1 id="section2">Volunteering in Honduras</h1>
          <p>While this isn't an achievement in computer science, this is something that lies very close to my heart. Over the summer of junior and senior year, I went to Honduras for a missions trip to help out in Mogote, Honduras. At first, it almost seemed unreal. No one I knew was coming on this trip, I only got the opportunity since my dad had worked with the lead pastor, and as things fell into place, I ended up going to Honduras. What I saw and did in Honduras was beyond anything I had ever imagined doing. We helped out in many houses, doing a vareity of jobs, from things as simple to handing out food to things a complex as erecting a full house. The whole experience changed my view on life, even if that does sound dramatic. It is something vital that shapes how I view computer science and will certainly continue to impact my future. </p>
